# Intro
This program was made for CSE331 in Spring 2023, by Korbin Shelley.

## How to use it

In order to compile the program, run `make all` in the directory containing the make file. This will compile all the object files and create an executable in the cwd. 

To run the program, do `./cachesim {configFile.conf} {traceFile.conf}`

To clean up the compiled files after usage, run `make clean`.
